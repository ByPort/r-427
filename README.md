**ATTENTION:** you should use latest version of one of popular browsers to work (e.g. Chrome is highly recommended).

## Deploying frontend

Install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run project locally...

```bash
npm start
```

...or build it.

```bash
npm run build
```

**Note** that first you should download and place standalone simulator into `/public`. Else you will not able to open it from this app.
